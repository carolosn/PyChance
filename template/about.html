  <h2>About PyChance Casino</h2>
  <p>
    PyChance is a fictional online casino created as a class project
    to practice Python, Flask, and web development concepts.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of this site is to simulate a simple gaming platform where
    users can navigate between pages, view different games, manage a wallet,
    and access help and contact information just like a real website.
  </p>
  <p>
    No real money is used on this site. All funds and bets are simulated
    for educational purposes only.
